<p>Acute care hospitals are defined in the National Health Data Dictionary (NHDD) as 'establishments which provide at least minimal medical, surgical or obstetric services for inpatient treatment and/or care, and which provide round-the-clock comprehensive qualified nursing services as well as other necessary professional services. They must be licensed by the State health departments, or controlled by government departments. Most of the patients have acute conditions or temporary ailments and the average stay per admission is relatively short. Hospitals specialising in dental, ophthalmic aids and other specialised medical or surgical care are included in this category'.</p>
